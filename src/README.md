üß† Branch Purpose: Model Development & Rigor 

This branch documents the process of selecting and optimizing the core forecasting model for the InventoryAI MVP. All development work here focuses on machine learning rigor, metrics integration, and comparative analysis.

Goal: Determine the most accurate model (Prophet, Ridge, or Naive) by comparing their performance against a robust baseline.

üìä Model Performance Comparison (W&B Dashboard)
All experiment results are logged in real-time to Weights & Biases (W&B). The initial comparison confirms the Prophet Model is the strongest candidate, achieving the lowest error (lowest MAE/MAPE).
